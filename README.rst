Simple Media Scanner
********************

Why did I develop this?
=======================

Usual media players for Android see the content provider to know where media
files are. The content provider is updated by Android, but the process for it
crashes very often. As a result, I could not play new music. I must update it by
myself. This is why I developed this.

What does this application do?
==============================

This application registers media files to the content provider in traversing
given directories.

This application requires no permissions.
